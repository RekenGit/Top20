This program was made to order.
It work with Excel files, can modify, write new data to sheet.
It's main goal is to make working with large amount of data easier, and make it way more quicker.

There are 4 options that user can chose from:
- Gray one need 2 files, one of them is Database file, and second is a sheet that data will be copied from. it just take data from sheet and place it in the right place on the database file.
- Orange, It also need 2 files. It just take new data from sheet and update the existing one in database.
- Green, It also need 2 files. Take needed data from data base, and place it into sheet.
- Red, needs only one file. This file is working based on data that its in it. It make new table at the end of sheet and make an summary of needed data that user want.
